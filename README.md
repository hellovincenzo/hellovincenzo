## 🧠 Engineering Focus

I specialize in **real-time frontend systems**, where performance, UX precision, and scalability matter most.

From **Canvas-based trading charts** to **Web3 transaction flows**, I build interfaces that feel instant, resilient, and iconic.

> Most of my work lives inside high-scale private platforms (Binance, fintech, crypto infra).  
> Open-source drops are coming — currently operating in **stealth execution mode**.
